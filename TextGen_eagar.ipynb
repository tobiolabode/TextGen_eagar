She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people!\\r\\nLooking forward to being in the Great State of Ohio on Saturday night where I will be campaigning hard for a truly talented future Congressman @Troy_Balderson. See you all then! Tickets:\\r\\nWhen the House and Senate meet on the very important Farm Bill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we love our farmers - hopefully they will be able to leave the WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD STAMPS PROVISION that the House approved. Senate should go to 51 votes!\\r\\nPennsylvania has to love Trump because unlike all of the others before me I am bringing STEEL BACK in a VERY BIG way. Plants opening up in Pennsylvania and all over the Country and Congressman Lou Barletta who is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania is really helping!\\r\\nLooking forward to being in the Great State of Pennsylvania where we had a tremendous victory in the Election. Will be campaigning hard for an original supporter Lou Barletta to replace a weak an ineffective Senator Bob Casey. Lou is tough and smart loves PA and our Country!\\r\\nCongressman Steve Stivers of Ohio has done a fantastic job as Chairman of the @NRCC. He is a great Congressman who is tough on crime &amp; borders &amp; an inspiration to our Military &amp; Vets. Big on 2nd Amendment. Get out and vote for Steve on Aug 7th.

How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marc Thiessen Washington Post\\r\\nRussian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!\\r\\nPaul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!\\r\\n..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!\\r\\n.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ALAN DERSHOWITZ....\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one.

Make America Great Again!\\r\\nThe globalist Koch Brothers who have become a total joke in real Republican circles are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade.

The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 (increased from 13 including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\\r\\n...and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!\\r\\n...dying newspaper industry. No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people! As an example the failing New York Times...\\r\\n...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the...\\r\\nWhen the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government it  truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk! Very unpatriotic!

Must get rid of Lottery Catch &amp; Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!\\r\\nThe biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women.\\r\\nHad a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media &amp; how that Fake News has morphed into phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnemy of the People.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sad!\\r\\nPlease understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes.

Rarely have I seen a candidate with such great potential. West Point graduate successful businessman and a African American leader...\\r\\nGREAT GDP numbers just released. Will be having a news conference soon!\\r\\n.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer. Gee I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\\r\\n....the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waste my time with dumb questions NO....\\r\\nArrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U.S. Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion...\\r\\nWay to go Jerry. This is what the league should do!\\r\\nThe Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States!

He has written a new and very important book...\\r\\nPROMISES KEPT!\\r\\nThank you @U_S_Steel and Granite City Illinois!\\r\\nThe United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson a great Christian family man and wonderful human being.

Looking  forward to being with many great friends!\\r\\nTwitter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSHADOW BANNING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.\\r\\nEuropean Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also they will be buying vast amounts of LNG!\\r\\nGreat to be back on track with the European Union. This was a big day for free and fair trade!\\r\\nThank you Georgia! They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! Two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to Brian!\\r\\nObviously the European Union as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States as represented by yours truly love each other!\\r\\n...along quickly. European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them. There was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!\\r\\nGreat meeting on Trade today with @JunckerEU and representatives of the European Union. We have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies. Work on documents has already started and the process is moving...\\r\\nThank you very much working hard!\\r\\nSergio Marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant &amp; successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford. It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS he loved the car industry and fought hard for it. He will be truly missed!\\r\\nThis week my Administration is hosting the first-ever #IRFMinisterial. The U.S. will continue to promote #ReligiousFreedom around the world. Nations that support religious freedom are far more free prosperous &amp; peaceful. Great job @VP @SecPompeo @IRF_Ambassador &amp; @StateDept!\\r\\nThe United States and the European Union have a $1 TRILLION bilateral trade relationship \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the largest economic relationship in the world. We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens...\\r\\nCongratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow 69-30 those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!\\r\\nWhat kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!\\r\\nChina is targeting our farmers who they know I love &amp; respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.\\r\\nWhen you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well be cool. The end result will be worth it!\\r\\nEvery time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton &amp; Frame Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a Hot Seller already Number One! More importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!\\r\\nSo sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!\\r\\nThe European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it we are ready - but they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to be in Kansas City Missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make FREEDOM possible! Thank you @VFWHQ! #VFWConvention\\r\\nOn the heels of the VERY successful launch of the @WhiteHouse National Council for the American Worker Congress should reauthorize #PerkinsCTE and ensure the American workforce remains stronger than EVER! #Jobs #Workforce\\r\\nI want to thank the @VFWHQ for your devotion to our fallen heroes unknown soldiers Prisoners of War those Missing in Action and their families. #VFWConvention\\r\\n#VFWConvention @VFWHQ\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want Trump!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nHeading to Missouri to be with many of my great friends. VFW here we come!\\r\\nOur Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!\\r\\nToday is the day to vote for Brian Kemp. Will be great for Georgia full Endorsement!\\r\\nTariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as simple as that - and everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking! Remember we are the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpiggy bank\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being robbed. All will be Great!\\r\\nCountries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never!\\r\\n#MadeInAmerica Showcase!\\r\\nLou Barletta was one of my first supporters. He is tough on Crime and Borders. Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania. His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders. We need Lou!\\r\\nRobert will do a great job for our Vets. We also recently won Choice!\\r\\n....In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?\\r\\nThe Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelivery boy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a BIG percentage of their packages....\\r\\nA Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me (always anonymous sources) that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong very happy!\\r\\nWhen you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media!\\r\\n.....\\xe2\\x80\\x9dCarter Page wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a spy wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America. They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now!\\r\\n....and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....\\r\\nSo we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!\\r\\nTom Fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 A.M. NOW! Judicial Watch.\\r\\nTo Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp; DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!\\r\\nSo President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he do something about it? Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!\\r\\nHappy Birthday @SenatorDole!\\r\\nI had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!\\r\\n.@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSource #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ILLEGAL!\\r\\nAndrew McCarthy - \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!\\r\\nLooking more &amp; more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\\r\\nCongratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam!\\r\\nWatching Los Angeles possible hostage situation very closely. Active barricaded suspect. L.A.P.D. working with Federal Law Enforcement.\\r\\nTroy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime &amp; Borders.

Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders LOVES our Military Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!\\r\\nNo Collusion No Obstruction - but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!\\r\\nThe Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W.H.) seems intent on damaging the Republican Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9816 Election never ends!\\r\\nInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!\\r\\nThe NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it! Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart? The $40000000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling out for game. Second time kneeling out for season/no pay!\\r\\nI got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud &amp; vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!\\r\\nSo important. Should have been done years ago!\\r\\nFarmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!\\r\\n....The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due &amp; we are raising rates - Really?\\r\\nChina the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual not a level playing field...\\r\\nMy deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy such a great loss. May God be with you all!\\r\\nWill the Dems and Fake News ever learn? This is classic!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n....proliferation cyber attacks trade Ukraine Middle East peace North Korea and more. There are many answers some easy and some hard to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe Summit with Russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for Israel nuclear........\\r\\nI told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. but not for long!\\r\\nReally big jobs meeting today at the White House! 3 P.M.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.\\r\\nThe Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!\\r\\nThe Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction. Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll complain anyway!\\r\\nThe Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE!\\r\\nThank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs.\\r\\nA total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband &amp; father. He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him!\\r\\nThe two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS-13!\\r\\nThank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder! He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security. Now we need Congress to support. Kevin has been strong on Crime the Border the 2nd Amendment and he loves our Military and Vets. @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement!\\r\\nBrian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.\\r\\n3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition!\\r\\nSome people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  @foxandfriends  @kilmeade\\r\\nCongratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress. My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflood gates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy!\\r\\n....Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!\\r\\nWhile the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting..\\r\\nSo many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProsperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs!\\r\\nThe Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.\\r\\nThe meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success except in the Fake News Media!\\r\\nThe economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!\\r\\nThank you @RandPaul. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he supposed to think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWhile I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\\r\\nI had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me. NATO was weak but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money!\\r\\nThank you @RandPaul you really get it! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he supposed think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWill be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pmE and @TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at 8pmE. Enjoy!\\r\\nA productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world. #HELSINKI2018\\r\\nI would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #HELSINKI2018\\r\\nAs I said today and many times before \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two largest nuclear powers we must get along! #HELSINKI2018\\r\\nThank you Helsinki Finland!\\r\\nJoint Press Conference from Helsinki Finland:\\r\\nIt was an honor to join you this morning. Thank you!\\r\\nOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt!\\r\\nPresident Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen was no big deal &amp; did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!\\r\\nReceived many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present &amp; future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong &amp; rich!\\r\\nCongratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!\\r\\n...know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but at some point it will heal!\\r\\n...over the years I would return to criticism that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good enough \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition! Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems...\\r\\nHeading to Helsinki Finland \\xe2\\x80\\x93 looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...\\r\\nThere hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!\\r\\nThese Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to report the truth as usual!\\r\\nOur prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan. We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones.\\r\\n....Remember it was Little Jeff Z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said I could not win the election in that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was no way to 270\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (over &amp; over again) in the Electoral College. I got 306! They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. Still hurting!\\r\\nSo funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings) to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......\\r\\nThe stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election?\\r\\n....Where is the DNC Server and why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?\\r\\nThe stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administrations. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election?\\r\\nThe Stock Market hit 25000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!\\r\\nI have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.\\r\\nThis is now changing - for the first time!\\r\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xac\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa7\\r\\nJoint Press Conference with Prime Minister Theresa May...\\r\\nCongressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime the Border Illegal Immigration the 2nd Amendment our great Military &amp; Vets Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!\\r\\nGreat success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!\\r\\nA very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. In June for instance the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6% its lowest level ever from 4.9% in May.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThank you #NATO2018!\\r\\n#NATOSummit2018 Press Conference in Brussels Belgium:\\r\\n....On top of it all Germany just started paying Russia the country they want protection from Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment and that must ultimately go to 4%!\\r\\nPresidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade!\\r\\nAs I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena &amp; is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews\\r\\nBillions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!\\r\\nHow can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!\\r\\nEx-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow but is anybody really surprised!  Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!\\r\\nIf the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Obstruct and Resist but rather do it the good ol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fashioned way WIN ELECTIONS!\\r\\nWhat good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protection then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025.\\r\\nWhat good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?

I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!\\r\\n...things up better than ever before but it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win!\\r\\nI am in Brussels but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open...\\r\\nBilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels Belgium...\\r\\nJust talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!\\r\\nThe European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit) and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it. Just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work!\\r\\nA recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama.\\r\\nMany countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low) but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?\\r\\nInforming the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. #SCOTUS\\r\\nI am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace!\\r\\nOn behalf of the United States congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed great job!\\r\\nThank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made. Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. Economy is ROARING. Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS. New Poll says Trump at over 90% is the most popular Republican in history of the Party. Wow!\\r\\nNATO countries must pay MORE the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!\\r\\nGetting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (&amp; Barriers)!\\r\\nTonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. #SCOTUS\\r\\nHAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY to our amazing current and former Army Warrant Officers. Thank you for your century of service as the indispensable guardians of our great @USArmy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technology! #CenturyOfService\\r\\nPfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe &amp; elsewhere. We will respond!\\r\\nThe failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.\\r\\nI have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &amp; even more importantly our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!\\r\\nI have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M.\\r\\n...Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S. with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!\\r\\nThe United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office they must do much more. Germany is at 1% the U.S. is at 4% and NATO benefits.......\\r\\nThey just didn\\'t get it but they do now!\\r\\nLooking forward to announcing my final decision on the United States Supreme Court Justice at 9:00pmE tomorrow night at the @WhiteHouse.

We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!\\r\\nA vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities to let drugs pour into our cities and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans.

Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!\\r\\nNow that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S. my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!\\r\\nJust out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation to 2500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?\\r\\nMany good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party which includes the Fake News is complaining. If not for me we would now be at War with North Korea!\\r\\nHow can the Democrats who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security while the Democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!\\r\\nWhen we have an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfestation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out?

Nov.\\r\\nThe economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country.

On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!\\r\\nCrazy Maxine Waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with Nancy Pelosi the FACE of the Democrat Party.

These people will be voting for Republicans in November and in many cases joining the Republican Party!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands to the @WhiteHouse!\\r\\nCongratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!\\r\\nA big week especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!\\r\\nThe Liberal Left also known as the Democrats want to get rid of ICE who do a fantastic job and want Open Borders.

Make America Great Again\\r\\nI will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews\\r\\nWhen people come into our Country illegally we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering.

Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!\\r\\nI will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10:00 A. M. Enjoy!\\r\\nEither we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or Filibuster rule - or better yet do both. Cryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Chuck would do it on day one but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!\\r\\nI never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill either GOODLATTE 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.\\r\\nA friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will Sean Spicer has written a great new book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Briefing: Politics the Press and the President.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It is a story told with both heart and knowledge.

So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance It will never happen!\\r\\nThe Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE one of the smartest toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!\\r\\nThe new plant being built by Foxconn in Wisconsin is incredible. Congratulations to the people of Wisconsin and to Governor Scott Walker @GovWalker and his talented representatives for having pulled it off.

Where is the DNC Server and why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions so much corruption!\\r\\nLover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s closed door testimony and according to most reports refused to answer many questions.

Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\\r\\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!\\r\\nCongratulations to Maxine Waters whose crazy rants have made her together with Nancy Pelosi the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together they will Make America Weak Again!

Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place just LOST his primary election. In other words he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer and more respectful to his President!\\r\\nTremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York and my many friends on Staten Island have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!\\r\\nCongratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win! South Carolina loves you. We are all proud of you and Peggy! @henrymcmaster\\r\\nToday we tell the story of an incredible HERO who defended our nation in World War Two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner. Although he died 20 years ago today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American Valor...\\r\\nSUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S. and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Judge Andrew Napolitano\\r\\nThe face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.\\r\\nA Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!\\r\\nIt was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\\r\\n....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take very long!\\r\\n....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!\\r\\n....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!\\r\\nEarly this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is but we will fix it.....\\r\\nThank you South Carolina. Now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get out tomorrow and VOTE for @HenryMcMaster!\\r\\nJust landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly! #MAGA\\r\\nThe hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI &amp; DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!\\r\\nWhy is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirector David Lynch: Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nSurprised that Harley-Davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U. which has hurt us badly on trade down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!  #MAGA\\r\\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the Make America Great Again movement.

Speaking at 7:00 P.M.\\r\\n....If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tracks - and at very little by comparison cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!\\r\\nHiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......\\r\\nSuch a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!\\r\\nI have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to) because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp; FBI aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t giving over requested documents?\\r\\nThe Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside!\\r\\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually far greater than would ever have been believed!\\r\\n.@RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana we want Clay!\\r\\nHouse Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need 10 Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!\\r\\n.@ClayHiggins18 has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets.

He called &amp; said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmonster ratings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Be a man Jimmy!\\r\\nThe United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!\\r\\n....Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!\\r\\nWe cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...\\r\\nDemocrats fix the laws. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country.

A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!\\r\\nSteel is coming back fast! U.S. Steel is adding great capacity also. So are others.\\r\\nBased on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. &amp; its great companies and workers by the European Union if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!\\r\\nOur first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.\\r\\nWe are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens.

Need to keep prices down!\\r\\nWe must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it!\\r\\n80% of Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us which is fine with me. They do have though very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix.

He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!\\r\\nRepublicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\r\\nElect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!\\r\\nEven if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - &amp; the Dems are Obstructionists who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about Crime coming from Border!

They want open borders which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!\\r\\nThe Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration.

Tickets:\\r\\n#CHANGETHELAWS   Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration.

There was no Russian Collusion. Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!\\r\\nWashington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea. Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?\\r\\nOur economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well and moving back to America and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.\\r\\nThe denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives!\\r\\nHolding back the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwar games\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. Also quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down which I hope will not happen!\\r\\nFunny how the Fake News in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world &amp; more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!\\r\\nDaniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis IG Report makes it clear as did Rod Rosenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memo that Trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Witch Hunt!\\r\\nPlease clear up the Fake News!\\r\\nChuck Schumer said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank you Chuck but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites. Hostages already back hero remains coming home &amp; much more!\\r\\nThe IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!\\r\\nThe IG Report totally distroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!\\r\\nMy supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. As we get stronger so does our country. Best numbers ever!\\r\\nDemocrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things High Taxes High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!\\r\\nGreat discussions with European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk at the #G7Summit in Canada last week.\\r\\nThe Fake News Media said that I did not get along with other Leaders at the #G7Summit in Canada. They are once again WRONG!\\r\\nI have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for!\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!\\r\\nWow what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort who has represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!\\r\\nThe Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall end Catch &amp; Release Visa Lottery and Chain and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mark Levin\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy in the world didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asks Mark Levin!\\r\\nWow the highest rated (by far) morning show @foxandfriends is on the Front Lawn of the White House. Maybe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?\\r\\nU.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy and jobs would have been a disaster!\\r\\nThank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A. Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.\\r\\nThe IG Report is a total disaster for Comey his minions and sadly the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!\\r\\nFBI Agent Peter Strzok who headed the Clinton &amp; Russia investigations texted to his lover Lisa Page in the IG Report that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any lower than that!\\r\\nHappy #FlagDay\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\r\\nHappy 243rd Birthday to the @USArmy! Thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the U.S.A. We love you!\\r\\n....Schneiderman who ran the Clinton campaign in New York never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.\\r\\nThe sleazy New York Democrats and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t settle this case!...\\r\\nSo the Democrats make up a phony crime Collusion with the Russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!\\r\\nNow that I am back from Singapore where we had a great result with respect to North Korea the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.\\r\\nThe Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers. People are starting to see what is being done. Results are speaking loudly. North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!\\r\\nCongratulations to @KevinCramer on his huge win in North Dakota. We need Kevin in the Senate and I strongly endorse him. Heidi voted NO on our Tax Cuts and always will vote no when we need her. Kevin is strong on Crime &amp; Borders big on Cutting Taxes!\\r\\nCongratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada. Danny worked hard an got a great result. Looking good in November!\\r\\nSenator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are not for her. People are really upset so phony! Josh Hawley should win big and has my full endorsement.\\r\\nSo funny to watch the Fake News especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbegged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!\\r\\nOil prices are too high OPEC is at it again. Not good!\\r\\nThe U.S. together with Mexico and Canada just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work!\\r\\nWe save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!\\r\\nBefore taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight!\\r\\nJust landed - a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!\\r\\nCongratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff Tim Kaine who is weak on crime and borders and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t underestimate Corey a major chance of winning!\\r\\n...realize the economy is the best it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!\\r\\nRobert De Niro a very Low IQ individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpunch-drunk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I guess he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t...\\r\\nMy political representatives didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate and Sanford was so bad I had to give it a shot. Congrats to Katie Arrington!\\r\\nA year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads people that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace - \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplease meet don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meet do not meet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe! No more rocket launches nuclear testing or research! The hostages are back home with their families. Thank you to Chairman Kim our day together was historic!\\r\\nI want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x93 proves that real change is possible!\\r\\nThere is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement w/ the world. Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security &amp; prosperity for his citizens!\\r\\nIt\\'s time for another #MAGA rally. Join me in Duluth Minnesota on Wednesday June 20th at 6:30pm!Tickets\\xe2\\x9e\\x9c\\r\\nHere is the video \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Story of Opportunity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that I shared with Kim Jong-un at the #SingaporeSummit\\xe2\\x9e\\xa1\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\r\\n...realize the economy is the best it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country.

I watched him last night and truly believe he may be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpunch-drunk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I guess he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t...\\r\\n...Got along great with Kim Jong-un who wants to see wonderful things for his country. As I said earlier today: Anyone can make war but only the most courageous can make peace! #SingaporeSummit\\r\\nHeading back home from Singapore after a truly amazing visit. Great progress was made on the denuclearization of North Korea. Hostages are back home will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families no missiles shot no research happening sites closing...\\r\\nMark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!\\r\\nI strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada. Adam is smart works hard and knows how to win. He will be a great Governor. Also will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime!\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Great Larry Kudlow who has been working so hard on trade and the economy has just suffered a heart attack. He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center.\\r\\nJust won big Supreme Court decision on Voting! Great News!\\r\\nThe fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S. say the haters &amp; losers. We have our hostages testing research and all missle launches have stoped and these pundits who have called me wrong from the beginning have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!\\r\\nStock Market up almost 40% since the Election with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades with Black &amp; Hispanic unemployment lowest in History and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever!\\r\\nMeetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen!\\r\\nThank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong!\\r\\nSorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!\\r\\nGreat to be in Singapore excitement in the air!\\r\\n....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!\\r\\n....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!\\r\\nWhy should I as President of the United States allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses as they have for decades while our Farmers Workers &amp; Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...\\r\\nFair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!\\r\\nPM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUS Tariffs were kind of insulting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill not be pushed around.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Very dishonest &amp; weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\\r\\nBased on Justin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s false statements at his news conference and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers workers and companies I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!\\r\\nI am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World. It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...\\r\\nThe United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that is long enough.\\r\\n...U.S.A. Trade. They fully understand where I am coming from. After many decades fair and reciprocal Trade will happen!\\r\\nJust left the @G7 Summit in beautiful Canada. Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I cannot allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to...\\r\\nJust met the new Prime Minister of Italy @GiuseppeConteIT a really great guy. He will be honored in Washington at the @WhiteHouse shortly. He will do a great job - the people of Italy got it right!\\r\\nHenry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning. He is strong on Crime and Borders great for our Military and our Vets. He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor and has my full endorsement a special guy.

They are truly all HEROES.\\r\\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somolia. They are truly all HEROES.\\r\\nI am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization. Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while!\\r\\nCongratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin the team captain was spectacular - a true Superstar! D.C. is popping in many ways. What a time!\\r\\nLooking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen we come out even better!\\r\\nCanada charges the U.S. a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products! They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you that did they? Not fair to our farmers!\\r\\nObama Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea and now weak on Crime High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need his advice!\\r\\nWhy isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers workers &amp; companies. Take down your tariffs &amp; barriers or we will more than match you!\\r\\nPrime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hurting our Farmers killing our Agriculture!\\r\\nPlease tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.\\r\\nGreat day of meetings with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan!\\r\\nPM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the U.S. and Japan something we have to do. The U.S. seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working hard to reduce our trade imbalance...\\r\\nToday I am greatly honored to welcome my good friend PM Abe of Japan to the @WhiteHouse. Over the past 16 months the Prime Minister and I have worked closely together to address common challenges of which there are many...\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @AbeShinzo back to the @WhiteHouse!\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xaf\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb5\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates credit GOP tax cuts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTotal jobless claims running at lowest level in 44 years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTotal jobless claims running at lowest level in 44 years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThe Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmatter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as Comey would call it). Investigate!\\r\\nWhen will people start saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthank you Mr. President for firing James Comey?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nOur Justice Department must not let Awan &amp; Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplea deal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!\\r\\nLooking forward to seeing my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan at noon.

Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face it he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Flake!\\r\\nWhen and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax.

We are proud of you Dana!\\r\\nMany more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember Dems are High Tax High Crime easy to beat!\\r\\n...Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever. Fake News is really bad!\\r\\nThe Fake News Media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great First Lady Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia to abuse. All Fake she is doing really well!\\r\\nGold Star father Ceejay Metcalf whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends. He is a special man!\\r\\nGreat night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win.

This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff\\r\\nChris Farrell Judicial Watch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...\\r\\nGreat interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?\\r\\nWow Strzok-Page the incompetent &amp; corrupt FBI lovers have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine how much wasteful spending we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d save if we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending and to what end? No more.\\r\\nThe HISTORIC Rescissions Package we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve proposed would cut $15000000000 in Wasteful Spending!

It was a great day for a great sport!\\r\\nMeeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big...we will soon see!\\r\\nThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues all because Jeff Sessions didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\\r\\nWe have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs Houston Astros Pittsburgh Penguins New England Patriots Alabama and Clemson National Champions and many others. National Anthem &amp; more great music today at 3:00 P.M.\\r\\nWe will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M. The White House with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America!

Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell the public has the right to know.

Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington D.C.?\\r\\nWhat ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server?\\r\\nNow that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!\\r\\n...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails got $145000000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife $700000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.\\r\\n....At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking at the corruption...\\r\\nThings are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!\\r\\nIf the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!\\r\\nGreat to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!\\r\\nGreat to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melanie is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!\\r\\nHappy #ArmedForcesDay to our GREAT military men and women for their selfless service to our Nation!\\r\\nAmerica is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. We have ended the war on coal and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance!\\r\\nCalifornia finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the best Governor you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!\\r\\nJust met with UN Secretary-General Ant\\xc3\\xb3nio Guterres who is working hard to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake the United Nations Great Again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job!\\r\\nAmerica is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption. America is a Nation that believes in second chances - and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come! #PrisonReform\\r\\nWe grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas. To the students families teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever...\\r\\nSchool shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all!\\r\\nReports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president. It took place very early on and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!\\r\\nWhy isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!\\r\\nFake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnimals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnimals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cApparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t commit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  David Asman  @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett   Really bad stuff!\\r\\nIt was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center. There is nobody like them!\\r\\nTomorrow the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill which includes work requirements. We must support our Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great farmers!\\r\\nGreat talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week. He is doing such a good job for Argentina. I support his vision for transforming his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy and unleashing its potential!\\r\\nTalking trade with the Vice Premier of the People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republic of China Liu He.\\r\\nCongratulations to our new CIA Director Gina Haspel!\\r\\nCongrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!\\r\\nDespite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is!\\r\\nWow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrew McCarthy says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If so this is bigger than Watergate!\\r\\nWow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrew McCarthy says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If so this is bigger than Watergate!\\r\\nCongratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!\\r\\nGina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA. She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately. We need her to keep our great country safe! #ConfirmGina\\r\\n...and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also weak on borders and crime. Sadly our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr. Lou Barletta will win! #MAGA\\r\\nLou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent Bob Casey has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi Elizabeth Warren lines loves sanctuary cities bad and expensive healthcare...\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the @WhiteHouse!\\r\\nHouse votes today on Choice/MISSION Act. Who will stand with our Great Vets caregivers and Veterans Service Organizations? Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day!\\r\\n...haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even started yet! The U.S. has very little to give because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!\\r\\n...We have not seen China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demands yet which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. China has seen our demands. There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe the meetings...\\r\\nThe Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China. Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China...\\r\\nCongratulations to Deb Fischer. The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #MAGA\\r\\nCongratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been represented in many years. Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThank you to the Washington Examiner and @CortesSteve on the great article - on WINNING!\\r\\n#PeaceOfficersMemorialDay\\r\\nToday is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace. We stand with our police (HEROES) 100%!\\r\\nNebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today!\\r\\nCan you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media together with the  $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion) I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt but the People truly get it!\\r\\nTrade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S. for many years. Stay tuned!\\r\\nOur great First Lady is doing really well. Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. Thank you for so much love and support!\\r\\nHeading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady Melania. Successful procedure she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!\\r\\nThe so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are!\\r\\nZTE the large Chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.\\r\\n#USEmbassyJerusalem\\r\\nBig day for Israel. Congratulations!\\r\\nU.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews &amp; @FoxBusiness. Lead up to 9:00 A.M. (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel!\\r\\nSo sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. This kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful &amp; successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.\\r\\nRemember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now that will not happen!\\r\\nChina and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool it will all work out!\\r\\nPresident Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\\r\\nHappy Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day!!!\\r\\nThe Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do. STAY!\\r\\nIran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!\\r\\nNorth Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you a very smart and gracious gesture!\\r\\nWhy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Anti-Trust Division has been and is opposed to the AT&amp;T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a disgrace in reporting!\\r\\nBig week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all!\\r\\nThe American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not one that takes advantage of them. We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality affordable medication they need and deserve. We will not rest until the job is done!\\r\\nToday my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People. We will have tougher negotiation more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter!\\r\\nThank you Indiana! #MAGA\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\r\\nThe highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!\\r\\nFive Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!\\r\\nSenator Cryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal even going at it with President Obama &amp; then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!\\r\\nOn behalf of the American people WELCOME HOME!\\r\\nGina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA!\\r\\nLooking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.\\r\\nThe Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing) when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News so bad!\\r\\nSecretary Pompeo and his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!\\r\\nI am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date &amp; Place set.\\r\\nCongratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs.  His Socialist opponent in November should not do well a big failure in last job!\\r\\nCandace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinkers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!\\r\\nThe Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?\\r\\nThe Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we win?\\r\\nThe Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know what will happen. In just a short time the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most dangerous weapons....\\r\\nStatement on the Iran Nuclear Deal:\\r\\nJohn Kerry can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country!\\r\\nI will be speaking to my friend President Xi of China this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade where good things will happen and North Korea where relationships and trust are building.\\r\\nGina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  bright and glorious future!\\r\\nI will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.\\r\\nNational Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in! Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed! Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keep fighting this opioid epidemic America!\\r\\nThe United States does not need John Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!\\r\\nIs this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\\r\\nLisa Page who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover Peter S) and attorney Baker are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!\\r\\nGood luck to Ric Grenell our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy he will represent our Country well!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Great Revolt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men &amp; Women are forgotten no longer!\\r\\nThe 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait \\xe2\\x80\\x98till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!\\r\\nThe Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up phony crime.There is no O it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called Fighting Back\\r\\nMy highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!\\r\\nTo the great people of West Virginia we have together a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!\\r\\nThank you Cleveland Ohio!\\r\\nOur high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!\\r\\nJust returned home to the beautiful White House from Dallas where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA. It was so wonderful to be there!\\r\\nGreat book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder. Always known as somebody who knows how to win \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCapitalist Comeback\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be a big hit!\\r\\nI want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA. We will never fail and we will always protect your Second Amendment! God Bless you and God Bless America!\\r\\nWe are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!\\r\\nDemocrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!\\r\\nAll of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator and that no Government can ever take it away. We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement. We have pride in our history...\\r\\nJUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime WITCH HUNT!\\r\\nGoing to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!\\r\\nNBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite \\xe2\\x80\\x9csources\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which are constantly wrong. Problem is like so many others the sources probably don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist they are fabricated fiction! NBC my former home with the Apprentice is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!\\r\\nAndy McCarthy will be on  @LouDobbs tonight. 7:00 P.M.  @FoxBusiness.\\r\\nBecause Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!\\r\\nOur Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!\\r\\n#NationalDayOfPrayer\\r\\nThis spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis. We won\\'t forget what happened to our GREAT VETS. Choice is vital but the program needs work &amp; is running out of $. Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve. I will sign immediately!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to celebrate the #NationalDayOfPrayer at the @WhiteHouse in the Rose Garden! Proclamation:\\r\\n...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction.\\r\\n...very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair......\\r\\nMr. Cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as a non-disclosure agreement or NDA. These agreements are.....\\r\\nOur great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!\\r\\nAinsley Earnhardt a truly great person just wrote a wonderful book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Light Within Me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is doing really well. She is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!\\r\\nAs everybody is aware the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp but to no avail. Stay tuned!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  John Dowd March 2018.  With North Korea China the Middle East and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no Russian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCollusion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nI have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHercules\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims their families and the great men and women of the National Guard.\\r\\nCongratulations @SecPompeo!\\r\\nA Rigged System - They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjustice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!\\r\\nNEW BOOK - A MUST READ! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.

A rigged system!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe questions are an intrusion into the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Article 2  powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfettered power to fire anyone...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Joe Digenova former US Attorney\\r\\nThere was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup &amp; trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more. Witch Hunt!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse!\\r\\nCongratulations @ArmyWP_Football!\\r\\nToday I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trophy for the first time in 21 years to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse.

Witch Hunt!\\r\\nDelegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea this should have been fixed years ago not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!\\r\\nSo disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleaked\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh I see...you have a made up phony crime Collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!\\r\\nThe White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbonkers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!\\r\\nDuring Small Business Week we celebrate the great hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!\\r\\nThe migrant \\xe2\\x80\\x98caravan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.\\r\\nI recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp\\r\\nNumerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North &amp; South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!\\r\\nThe White House Correspondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for.

Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.\\r\\nThe White House Correspondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomedian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d totally bombed (couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance).

Very dishonest and sick!\\r\\nLook forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight will be live on T.V.\\r\\nJust had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea.

Not fair Tester!\\r\\nAllegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign.

He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!\\r\\nThe U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.

The American people are finally back to work!\\r\\nMexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also we must get Wall funding fast.\\r\\nDespite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL\\r\\nHard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.

Where are Memos on Clinton Lynch &amp; others?\\r\\nSylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson.

Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really does everybody know what that means?\\r\\nJust heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.\\r\\nNorth Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site.

The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!\\r\\nLooks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!\\r\\nNancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!\\r\\nSo exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis Maryland. Looking forward to being there.\\r\\nSo General Michael Flynn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so!\\r\\nJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\\r\\nJames Comey just threw Andrew McCabe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the bus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?\\r\\nSanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult!\\r\\nMy thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.\\r\\nMike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!\\r\\n...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!\\r\\nDemocrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People.

Heading to a briefing with the Joint Interagency Task Force South NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM.\\r\\nGovernor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cup to 400 National Guard Troops\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charade. We need border security and action not words!\\r\\nThank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California\\'s illegal and unconstitutional \\'Sanctuary\\' policies. California\\'s dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all Americans at risk.\\r\\nGreat meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan who has just left Florida.

We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month!\\r\\nSlippery James Comey the worst FBI Director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!\\r\\nMike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea!\\r\\nA sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!\\r\\nThere is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested &amp; breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security &amp; Safety NOW!\\r\\nWhile Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.\\r\\nPastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!\\r\\nIt is my great honor to host @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo!\\r\\n.@FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:\\r\\n.@FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:\\r\\nStates and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers.

Keep America Safe!\\r\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by....\\r\\nWelcome Prime Minister Abe!\\r\\nRasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!\\r\\nGetting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman!\\r\\nSo many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking really nice to see!\\r\\nLooks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!\\r\\nI am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.\\r\\nEmployment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!\\r\\nRussia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!\\r\\nComey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes!\\r\\nJust hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things.\\r\\nSlippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far!\\r\\nAttorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!\\r\\nI never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmemos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are self serving and FAKE!\\r\\nThe Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMission Accomplished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!\\r\\nComey throws AG Lynch \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the bus!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!\\r\\nThe big questions in Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s badly reviewed book aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $700000 &amp; more?\\r\\nUnbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!\\r\\nSo proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had. There won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be anything or anyone even close!\\r\\nA perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!\\r\\n\\r\\nDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!\\r\\nWe are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA!\\r\\n....untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbotch jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!\\r\\nJames Comey is a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....\\r\\nTremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!\\r\\nWould only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama. We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations Japan who has hit us hard on trade for years!\\r\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest treasure is our people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK. We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity purpose and pride. AMERICAN SPIRIT is back! #TaxCuts\\r\\nThank you to all of the American workers who travelled here today!

Join me live:\\r\\nI have agreed with the historically cooperative disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb my Special Counsel and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.\\r\\nOn Yom HaShoah we remember the six million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust. With each passing year our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #NeverAgain. #HolocaustRemembranceDay\\r\\nGood luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today. He will be a great Secretary of State!\\r\\nNever said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event the United States under my Administration has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you America?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry good move for the safety of our Country!\\r\\nIf I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December as reported by the Failing New York Times I would have fired him.

More information:\\r\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!\\r\\nMuch of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy!\\r\\nOur relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?\\r\\nRussia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia  because they will be coming nice and new and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\\r\\n....doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back) so now they do the Unthinkable and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!\\r\\nSo much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China the coming North Korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton &amp; Larry K on board. I (we) are\\r\\nThe Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen not a Ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype) hosted by Doug in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House.

Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price...\\r\\nPresident Xi and I will always be friends no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do. Taxes will become Reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries!\\r\\nThe Washington Post is far more fiction than fact.

Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!\\r\\nChina which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\\r\\nDespite the Aluminum Tariffs Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not!

We cannot let this continue!\\r\\nOur Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico &amp; Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era and other laws NOW!

We will be taking strong action today.\\r\\nWas just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\\xe2\\x80\\x99s HQ in San Bruno California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved.

Congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence! #BalticSummit:\\r\\nI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue (or do they?)!\\r\\nThank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Obama at the same time in his Administration.\\r\\nCheck out the fact that you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!\\r\\nThe big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeak Laws\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!\\r\\nThe Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFakers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at CNN NBC ABC &amp; CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!\\r\\n#AutismAwarenessDay #LightItUpBlue\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump\\'s approval rate among likely U.S. voters hit 50 percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama\\'s score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Via: @Anna_Giaritelli @DCExaminer\\r\\n39% of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!\\r\\nHonduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!\\r\\nAs ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp; Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Donald J. Trump Proclaims April 2 2018 World Autism Awareness Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAn honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll!\\r\\nSo sad that the Department of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!\\r\\nOnly fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!\\r\\nSo funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.\\r\\nMexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!\\r\\nDACA is dead because the Democrats didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!\\r\\n...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress our country is being stolen!\\r\\nMexico has the absolute power not to let these large \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaravans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws.....\\r\\nThese big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!\\r\\nMexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL!\\r\\nBorder Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaravans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\\r\\nHAPPY EASTER!\\r\\nGovernor Jerry \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoonbeam\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews\\r\\n...does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clobbyist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincreased its parcel rates Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!\\r\\nWhile we are on the subject it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y.

Together we are making the economy great again!\\r\\nWe are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio. A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!\\r\\nI have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.) and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\\r\\n....In the interim Hon.

In the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!\\r\\nFor years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!\\r\\nTHE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens NO WAY.

Fame &amp; fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......\\r\\nMuch can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!\\r\\nBecause of the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!\\r\\nFrance honors a great hero.

Well not saying that anymore!\\r\\nCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault.

Most importantly got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\\r\\n.....They can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine ISIS Iran and even the coming Arms Race.

Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!\\r\\n....On 18 to 21 Age Limits watching court cases and rulings before acting.

Things are moving rapidly on this but not much political support (to put it mildly).\\r\\nVery strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law. Armed guards OK deterrent!.......\\r\\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A.

Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!\\r\\nThe Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW!\\r\\nThe Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.\\r\\n...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story Maggie Haberman a Hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.\\r\\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out.

If they drop their horrific barriers &amp; tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!\\r\\nIn the first hours after hearing that North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end the press was startled &amp; amazed.They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.

Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!\\r\\nPossible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\\r\\nFederal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump has the right to end DACA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I am waiting for the Dems they are running for the hills!\\r\\nLowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding of course)!\\r\\nWe will see what happens!\\r\\nWe are getting it done - jobs and security!\\r\\nTotal inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!\\r\\nThe new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!\\r\\nWhy did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.\\r\\nTo protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST\\r\\n...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.\\r\\nWe have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies &amp; jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also Canada must..\\r\\nWe are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThe Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!\\r\\nIf the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!\\r\\nThe United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery stupid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!\\r\\nMainstream Media in U.S. is being mocked all over the world. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone CRAZY!\\r\\nHappy National Anthem Day!\\r\\nHeading to Billy Graham Funeral. A Special Man!\\r\\nREST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM!\\r\\nWhen a country Taxes our products coming in at say 50% and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO not fair or smart.

Great news for workers and JOBS JOBS JOBS! #MAGA\\r\\nOur Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free fair and SMART TRADE!\\r\\nMany ideas some good &amp; some not so good emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!\\r\\nIt was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities. As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland we are determined to turn our grief into action. Full meeting:\\r\\nToday we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored. We say a prayer for our country: that all across this land the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.\\r\\nStarting at a small Bible School in Florida Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival. From a large tent in Los Angeles to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957...\\r\\nToday in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace.\\r\\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.

Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!\\r\\nThe Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done faster than even Ronald Reagan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blown away\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thomas Binion of Heritage President Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis very active very conservative and very effective. Huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nBig legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!\\r\\nSuch a beautiful map thank you!\\r\\n.@SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved. Also big help on cutting regs. I am with him in his re-election all the way!\\r\\nTexas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the politically correct thing to do and I back him now.

This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!\\r\\nDem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!\\r\\nThe Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!\\r\\nBIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).\\r\\nDems are no longer talking DACA! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of sight out of mind\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!\\r\\nUnemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!\\r\\nDemocrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP!\\r\\nArmed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people.

GREAT DETERRENT!\\r\\n....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this.

Enjoy the race!\\r\\nThank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo\\r\\nGreat Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!\\r\\nThe Fake News of big ratings loser CNN.\\r\\nIf it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U.S. then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\\r\\nNow that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. But wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I a great candidate?\\r\\nI never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Russian \\xe2\\x80\\x9choax\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\\r\\nFinally Liddle\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Adam Schiff the leakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!\\r\\nNever gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!\\r\\nGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company!\\r\\nVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!\\r\\nJust like they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to solve the DACA problem why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to and now they just talk!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads\\r\\nThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman!\\r\\nFunny how the Fake News Media doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know!\\r\\nDeputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharges Deal Don A Big Win\\xe2\\x80\\x9d written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Russians had no impact on the election results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMelania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening!\\r\\nOur entire Nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in Parkland FL. To teachers law enforcement first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage!\\r\\nRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\\r\\nCannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.\\r\\nI will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.\\r\\nPresidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida:\\r\\n...lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill!\\r\\nThe Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe end of immigration enforcement in America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals) doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa...\\r\\nIn times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.\\r\\nWhile the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!\\r\\nSo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again!\\r\\nJust spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.\\r\\nMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\\r\\nToday I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depleted infrastructure.\\r\\nAs we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation:\\r\\nNegotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.\\r\\nOur infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. Bipartisan make deal Dems?\\r\\nThe journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!\\r\\nThank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!\\r\\nThis will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!\\r\\nJust spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!\\r\\nRep. Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp; smart loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!\\r\\n4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.\\r\\nSo many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA\\r\\nMy Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.\\r\\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the @WestervillePD.\\r\\nRepublicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!\\r\\n....agencies not just the FBI &amp; DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been victimized. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......\\r\\nPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\\r\\nAccording to the @nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!\\r\\nThe Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!\\r\\nJobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!\\r\\nCosts on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now!\\r\\nWithout more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!\\r\\nJust signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS!\\r\\nWow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpaper trail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprivate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.\\r\\nTime to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.\\r\\nAs long as we open our eyes to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace - and open our hearts to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love - then America will forever be the land of the free the home of the brave and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast\\r\\nI will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East.\\r\\nOur founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIN GOD WE TRUST.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne Nation Under God.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d #NationalPrayerBreakfast\\r\\nWill be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders and many friends including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!\\r\\nThe Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!\\r\\nCongratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics! What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration!\\r\\nBest wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the @Olympics! What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION!\\r\\nNEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!\\r\\nIn the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold days\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when good news was reported the Stock Market would go up. Today when good news is reported the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!\\r\\nCongratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement along with @NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commercial and international partners continues to show American ingenuity at its best!\\r\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America Ronald Reagan!\\r\\nToday we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13 and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it. Watch here:\\r\\nWe need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system.  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security.\\r\\nPolling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. If D\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oppose this deal they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t serious about DACA-they just want open borders.\\r\\nMy prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts\\r\\nSo disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST!\\r\\nThanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!\\r\\nRepresentative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!\\r\\nAny deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!\\r\\nLittle Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\\r\\nThank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!\\r\\nThe Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!\\r\\nCongratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!\\r\\nMy thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done!\\r\\n...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wall Street Journal\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....\\r\\nGreat jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion!\\r\\nThis memo totally vindicates \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\\r\\nRasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain \\xe2\\x80\\x9csacred cows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday!\\r\\nToday it was my honor to join the great men and women of @DHSgov @CustomsBorder @ICEgov and @USCIS at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling Virginia. Fact sheet:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump the orator outlines the greatness of America to Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disgust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWith 3.5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS 2018 is off to great start!\\xe2\\x9c\\x85Unemployment rate at 4.1%.\\xe2\\x9c\\x85Average earnings up 2.9% in the last year.\\xe2\\x9c\\x85200000 new American jobs.\\xe2\\x9c\\x85#MAGA\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tom Fitton JW\\r\\nThe top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank &amp; File are great people!\\r\\nThe Democrats just aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.\\r\\nThank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network for the first time ever with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!\\r\\nMarch 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist Blame Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix NOW!\\r\\nHeading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in \\xe2\\x80\\x9818.\\r\\nJoin me live for the #SOTU\\r\\nCongratulations to America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Secretary of @HHSGov Alex Azar!\\r\\nOur economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler as an example is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!\\r\\nSomebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\\r\\nDemocrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!\\r\\nI have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it!\\r\\nTaliban targeted innocent Afghans brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win!\\r\\nOn Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men women and children and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide. We pledge with all of our might and resolve: Never Again!\\r\\nThank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccatch &amp; release\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety &amp; Security reasons.\\r\\nThank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF! #Davos2018\\r\\nDACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!\\r\\nHeading back from a very exciting two days in Davos Switzerland. Speech on America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic revival was well received.

Many great discussions! #WEF18\\r\\nWill be interviewed on  @SquawkCNBC by @JoeSquawk coming up at 6:00amE from Davos Switzerland. Enjoy! #WEF18\\r\\nToday Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential.\\r\\nVery productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos Switzerland! #WEF18\\r\\nGreat bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities. #WEF18\\r\\nWill soon be heading to Davos Switzerland to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!\\r\\nIt was my great honor to welcome Mayor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from across America to the WH. My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best. Together we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity!\\r\\nEarlier today I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt Preston Cope their families and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you!\\r\\nTremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs Jobs Jobs!\\r\\nCryin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Chuck Schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no Wall there is no DACA. We must have safety and security together with a strong Military for our great people!\\r\\nWhere are the 50000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?  Blaming Samsung!\\r\\nThank you to General John Kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the Staff and others in the White House for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to WIN and few have won more than us!\\r\\nNobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!\\r\\nIn one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts perhaps 50000 and all in prime time. Wow!\\r\\nIn one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts perhaps 50000 all in prime time. Wow!\\r\\nEven Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank you for your honesty Jim!\\r\\nBig win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!\\r\\nEnd the Democrats Obstruction!\\r\\nDemocrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do it but are powerless!\\r\\nThe Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!\\r\\nThank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!\\r\\nGreat to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real long term budget no C.R.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s!\\r\\nEric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now!\\r\\nThe Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!\\r\\nUnprecedented success for our Country in so many ways since the Election. Record Stock Market Strong on Military Crime Borders &amp; ISIS Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL Massive Tax Cuts end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!\\r\\nBeautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\\r\\nDemocrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let that happen!\\r\\n#AMERICA FIRST!\\r\\nFor those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans!\\r\\nThis is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown\\r\\nDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!\\r\\nNot looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.\\r\\nExcellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!\\r\\nJust signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!\\r\\nToday I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life! You are living witnesses of this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShutting down the government is a very serious thing. People die accidents happen. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how I would vote right now on a CR OK?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif)\\r\\n.@WhiteHouse Briefing with Director Marc Short and Director Mick Mulvaney...\\r\\nGovernment Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!\\r\\nHouse of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!\\r\\nAMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big dreams bigger and always reaches for the stars. YOU are the ones who will shape America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destiny. YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity. And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA\\r\\nDeparting Pittsburgh now where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before!\\r\\nA government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!\\r\\nCHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension!\\r\\nWe need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!\\r\\nWill be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!\\r\\n....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeanuts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!\\r\\nThe Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water.....\\r\\nISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! Together there is nothing we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!\\r\\nDespite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!\\r\\nAnd the FAKE NEWS winners are...\\r\\nMain Street is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\\r\\nDuring the campaign I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers!\\r\\nI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\\r\\nToday we witnessed an incredible moment in history \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the presentation of Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99 highest civilian honor to our friend and true AMERICAN HERO Bob Dole. #CongressionalGoldMedal\\r\\nEric Trump on @foxandfriends  now!\\r\\n....we need to keep America safe including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system to one that is merit-based.\\r\\nNew report from DOJ &amp; DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms....\\r\\nToday it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Donald J. Trump Proclaims January 16 2018 as Religious Freedom Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nUnemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends\\r\\nDo you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!\\r\\nThe Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.\\r\\nWe must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!\\r\\nSenator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.\\r\\n...to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST &amp; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nStatement by me last night in Florida: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonestly I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want security at the border they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want.....\\r\\n...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (among many other things). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank you Stuart Varney.  @foxandfriends\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump not 0...\\r\\nI as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST\\r\\nDACA is probably dead because the Democrats don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.\\r\\n...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. I said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...\\r\\nSo much Fake News is being reported. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!\\r\\nYesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.\\r\\nAMERICA FIRST!\\r\\nThe Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!\\r\\nYesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr. King\\'s life and legacy.\\r\\nNever said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. Never said \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctake them out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust!\\r\\nSadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!\\r\\nThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\\r\\n....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshutdown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\n....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....\\r\\nThe so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded Chain &amp; Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....\\r\\nReason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeanuts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!\\r\\nThe Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain. USA!\\r\\nDemocrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!\\r\\nChrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!\\r\\nMore great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying $2000 bonus to U.S. employees!\\r\\nSmall Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!\\r\\nThank you Adam Levine The Federalist in interview on @foxandfriends  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nYesterday I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H.R. 2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. Together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States!\\r\\nGreat news as a result of our TAX CUTS &amp; JOBS ACT!\\r\\nWith that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c45 year low in illegal immigration this year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d @foxandfriends\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\\r\\nIn new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent or Good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.\\r\\nDisproven and paid for by Democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?  What a mess!\\r\\nGood news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!\\r\\nCutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy!\\r\\nThe United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1!\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States! Joint press conference:\\r\\nI want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThe single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!\\r\\nThe fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!\\r\\nIt just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.\\r\\n.@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SAFE. Everyone is so grateful!#LawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident @realDonaldTrump\\r\\nThank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy! Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree w/you more. TOGETHER we are #MAGA\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\r\\nAs I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval.\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve!\\r\\nHAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible!\\r\\nAs our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter I want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest Fake News Media a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!\\r\\nIran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!\\r\\nWhat a year it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been and we\\'re just getting started. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!!\\r\\nMy deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM\\r\\nWhy would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts &amp; more?\\r\\nIf the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning!\\r\\nBig protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nJobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!\\r\\nI use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpress\\xe2\\x80\\x9d now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent \\xe2\\x80\\x9csources\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are being used more often than ever. Many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction!\\r\\nOn Taxes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d @WSJ Report\\r\\nOppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!\\r\\nThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people are what their leaders fear the most....\\r\\nMany reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests\\r\\nThe Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp; ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!\\r\\nWhy is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\r\\nWhile the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax!\\r\\nIn the East it could be the COLDEST New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!\\r\\nTogether we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI\\'ve been saying it for a long long time. #NoKo\\r\\nCaught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!\\r\\nRetail sales are at record numbers.

FBI TAINTED.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!\\r\\nBased on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare the Democrats &amp; Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!\\r\\nI hope everyone is having a great Christmas then tomorrow it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!\\r\\nMERRY CHRISTMAS!!!\\r\\nMERRY CHRISTMAS!!\\r\\nPeople are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again.

Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!\\r\\nThe Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is.

You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nRemember the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year.

Good Republican candidates will win BIG!\\r\\nThe Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!\\r\\nWow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFBI lawyer James Baker reassigned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to @FoxNews.\\r\\nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\\r\\nHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\\r\\nRemember the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.\\r\\nToday it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country.

Sadly the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long &amp; beautiful list.\\r\\nAt some point and for the good of the country I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East it is time to start rebuilding our country!\\r\\nSo true!\\r\\nOur big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of \\xe2\\x80\\x9clove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!\\r\\nTHANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nHouse Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed Tax Cuts.

Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.\\r\\nThe train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!\\r\\nIvanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.\\r\\nRemember Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year. The media refuses to mention this. I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons) and they did. I also predicted  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would win. Republicans will do well in 2018 very well! @foxandfriends\\r\\nMore than a century after conquering flight the #WrightBrothers continue to motivate &amp; inspire Americans who never tire of exploration &amp; innovation.

I am honored to serve as your Commander-in-Chief. On behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service.

Today there are over 185000 pages as seen in the Roosevelt Room.Today we CUT THE RED TAPE! It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nWhen Americans are free to thrive innovate &amp; prosper there is no challenge too great no task too large &amp; no goal beyond our reach. We are a nation of explorers pioneers innovators &amp; inventors. We are nation of people who work hard dream big &amp; who never ever give up...\\r\\nToday we gathered in the Roosevelt Room for one single reason: to CUT THE RED TAPE! For many decades an ever-growing maze of regs rules and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars millions of jobs countless American factories &amp; devastated entire industries.\\r\\nAs a candidate I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working Americans. If you make your voices heard this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the dawn of a brilliant American future shining with PATRIOTISM PROSPERITY AND PRIDE!\\r\\nRepublican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime the Stock Market hit another record high!\\r\\nThank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.\\r\\nIf last night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election proved anything it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.\\r\\nWow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends\\r\\nThe reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.  I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!\\r\\nCongratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!\\r\\nWishing all of those celebrating #Hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.\\r\\nConsumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).\\r\\nThe people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion weak on Crime Military and Illegal Immigration Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!\\r\\nLightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbegging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill &amp; Crooked-USED!\\r\\nDespite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!\\r\\nAnother false story this time in the Failing @nytimes that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong!  Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdumbest man on television!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bad Reporting.\\r\\nVery little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!\\r\\nGetting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL!\\r\\nThings are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news and much more to come!\\r\\nNo American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not for criminal aliens!\\r\\nGreat Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\\xe2\\x80\\x99S TROPHY! Congratulations!\\r\\nGreat Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\\xe2\\x80\\x99S TROPHY (last time was 1996). Wow! Congratulations!\\r\\n.@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS he should be fired.\\r\\n.@DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue w/ thousands of people outside on their way in. Real photos now shown as I spoke. Packed house many people unable to get in. Demand apology &amp; retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!\\r\\nHave a great game today @USArmy and @USNavy - I will be watching. We love our U.S. Military. On behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service! #ArmyNavyGame #USA\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8\\r\\nIt was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum &amp; the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past &amp; dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom equality justice &amp; peace.\\r\\nHeading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor @PhilBryantMS. Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum!\\r\\nCNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!\\r\\nFake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmistake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?\\r\\nA big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat Jones in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.\\r\\nGREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola Florida. Arena was packed to the rafters the crowd was loud loving and really smart. They definitely get what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. Thank you Pensacola!\\r\\nWe believe that every American should stand for the National Anthem and we proudly pledge allegiance to one NATION UNDER GOD!\\r\\nThis is your land this is your home and it\\'s your voice that matters the most.

I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!\\r\\nLAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad on Crime Life Border Vets Guns &amp; Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!\\r\\nBig crowd expected today in Pensacola Florida for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more!

Enjoy!\\r\\nWith the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!\\r\\nPutting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. Look at your 401-k\\xe2\\x80\\x99s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!\\r\\nDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!\\r\\nReport: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now it all starts to make sense!\\r\\nPeople who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!\\r\\nAfter years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.\\r\\nTainted (no very dishonest?) FBI \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in Clinton probe under review.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.\\r\\nSuch a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco!\\r\\nI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\\r\\nCongratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpapers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d should do the same with their Fake News!\\r\\nMany people in our Country are asking what the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacid washed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 33000 Emails? No justice!\\r\\nSo General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterrogation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard?\\r\\nGreat job First Lady Melania!\\r\\n62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history...\\r\\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\\r\\nBiggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!\\r\\nWe are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America. Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!\\r\\nEconomists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!\\r\\nRepublicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!\\r\\nThe jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.\\r\\nThe Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!\\r\\nA disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.\\r\\nThe Christmas Story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all\\xe2\\x80\\x94the gift of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for all of humanity.Whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life...\\r\\nToday is a day that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been looking very much forward to ALL YEAR LONG.

Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThe Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow and glum!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nStock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!\\r\\nThe Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.\\r\\nThe Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue!  @foxandfriends\\r\\nThe Failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!\\r\\nFunny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad the information (Crooked Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails) been released there would have been harm to National Security....\"Charles McCulloughFmr Intel Comm Inspector General\\r\\nThe only people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!\\r\\nThe House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump.

I should be given apology!\\r\\nThe real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...\\r\\n...and did not want to \"rock the boat.\" He didn\\'t \"choke\" he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.\\r\\nThe reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..\\r\\nThe Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!\\r\\nI am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!\\r\\nHillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!\\r\\nObama Administration official said they \"choked\" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election.

Sad!\\r\\n\"Stay on message\" is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!\\r\\nI have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!\\r\\nIt is not \"freedom of the press\" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\\r\\nI am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!\\r\\nMy rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.\\r\\nIf the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn\\'t put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%\\r\\nThe failing @nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change.

They can\\'t!\\r\\nA massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton\\'s agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!\\r\\nRatings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) \"the founder\" of ISIS &amp; MVP.

Already in Crimea!\\r\\nThis story is not about Mr. Khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!\\r\\nMr. Khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!\\r\\nWow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!\\r\\nThe dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?\\r\\nI was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!\\r\\nCaptain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our \"leaders\" to eradicate it!\\r\\nWe crushed the original goal!

END!\\r\\nCrooked\\'s stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 - with Bill VP\\r\\n#CrookedHillary = Obama\\'s third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.\\r\\nWord is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?\\r\\nI turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!\\r\\nWhy doesn\\'t the media want to report that on the two \"Big Thursdays\" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican\\'s won ratings\\r\\n#CrookedHillary\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!\\r\\nViolent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it.

She is owned by Wall Street!\\r\\nOur way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.\\r\\nHillary\\'s refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.\\r\\nI will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!\\r\\nDeparting now - thank you Cedar Rapids Iowa.

Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!\\r\\nHopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!\\r\\nThe Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!\\r\\nFunny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said \"Trump is a genius.\" America 1st!\\r\\nAs I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.\\r\\nJust like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.\\r\\nMany of Bernie\\'s supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?\\r\\nI hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!\\r\\nNo matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!\\r\\nYou have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly\\r\\nI\\'m with you!

Sad to watch.\\r\\nWhy aren\\'t the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great\\r\\nFunny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference\\r\\nBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.\\r\\nElizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!\\r\\nSad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.\\r\\nIf Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.\\r\\nI was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!\\r\\nHard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!\\r\\nWhile Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.\\r\\nClinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.\\r\\nThank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16\\r\\nThank you Roanoke Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nGreat POLL numbers are coming out all over.

But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!\\r\\nHere we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that\\'s all! They laughed at Bernie.\\r\\nIf Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.\\r\\nThank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!\\r\\nHow much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!\\r\\nThe new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me\\r\\nWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America\\'s problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!\\r\\nThe ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!\\r\\nThe highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she\\'s out!\\r\\nThe Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!\\r\\nEven though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don\\'t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out\\r\\nIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild\\r\\nThe @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don\\'t watch CNN!\\r\\nI always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!\\r\\nToday proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)\\r\\nSorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can\\'t go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!\\r\\nThere is no longer a Bernie Sanders \"political revolution.\" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!\\r\\nAn analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.\\r\\nLooks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!\\r\\nWow President Obama\\'s brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!\\r\\nBernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT\\r\\nThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16\\r\\nThank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!\\r\\nThe Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!\\r\\nJust saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don\\'t look presidential to me!\\r\\nI will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven\\'t had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!\\r\\nTim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!\\r\\nFunny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!\\r\\nCrooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.\\r\\nLeaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED\\r\\nPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn\\'t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!\\r\\nTim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!\\r\\nThe Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?\\r\\nI highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.\\r\\nIs it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn\\'t get indicted while Bob M did?\\r\\nAnother attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.\\r\\nOne of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove\\r\\nThank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!\\r\\nWhat a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all.

Please stand with us!\\r\\nSTATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH\\r\\nThe media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania\\'s speech than the FBI spent on Hillary\\'s emails.\\r\\nGood news is Melania\\'s speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!\\r\\nIn November I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!\\r\\nBill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.\\r\\nCongratulations to my children Don and Tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night.

The world is watching\\r\\nWe grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...\\r\\nThe ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That\\'s because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don\\'t like\\r\\n.@FoxNews is much better and far more truthful than @CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don\\'t watch.\\r\\nIf Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn\\'t lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H\\r\\nI hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!\\r\\nAs the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!\\r\\nWe are going to have a great time in Cleveland.

What was she thinking?\\r\\nIs Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!\\r\\nOn my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.\\r\\nVoters understand that Crooked Hillary\\'s negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.\\r\\nDespite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!\\r\\nLyin\\' Crooked Hillary\\'s email stories all have one thing in common.\\r\\nIs President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves?

They are not happy that he is selling out!\\r\\nBernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!\\r\\nThis election is a choice between law order &amp; safety - or chaos crime &amp; violence.

Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?\\r\\nBill Clinton\\'s meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.\\r\\nAs Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement.

We are the suckers-no more!\\r\\nA great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife @MELANIATRUMP today. #NewYorkValues\\r\\nBernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president.

What is in her hand??\\r\\nThis was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune.\\r\\nVictory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?\\r\\nWhy aren\\'t people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?\\r\\nWow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!\\r\\nHow come the @TODAYshow &amp; @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?\\r\\nI have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.\\r\\nWow @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn\\'t do their town-hall tonight!\\r\\nWe need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!\\r\\nLyin\\' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs &amp; illegal imm!\\r\\nLyin\\'Ted Cruz is weak &amp; losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates\\r\\nAfter the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!\\r\\nJust released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!\\r\\nTed Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!\\r\\nA detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called \"leaders\" ever learn!\\r\\n\"Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story\" via the Gateway Pundit:\\r\\nI will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!\\r\\nThe United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!\\r\\nSee Lyin\\' Ted even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio not Trump!\\r\\nJust to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming\\r\\nWhy can\\'t the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!\\r\\nAnother radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women &amp; children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve\\r\\nHappy Easter to all have a great day!\\r\\nMy statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!\\r\\nWow sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others\\r\\nI am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!\\r\\nRemember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!\\r\\nDon\\'t believe the @FoxNews Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.\\r\\nWisconsin\\'s economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs\\r\\nNobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!\\r\\nLyin\\' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!\\r\\nThe press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!\\r\\nThe media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!\\r\\nTop suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!\\r\\nWow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?\\r\\nI didn\\'t start the fight with Lyin\\'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin\\' Ted!\\r\\nJust won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nEndorsements for Lyin\\' Ted Cruz-\\r\\nEurope and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!\\r\\nJust announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!\\r\\nExplain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time\\r\\n.@TheView T.V. show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM \"NO\"\\r\\nHillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!\\r\\nIt is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!\\r\\nRemember when I recently said that Brussels is a \"hell hole\" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!\\r\\nThese politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!\\r\\n.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin\\' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!\\r\\nIt is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!\\r\\nWe pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!\\r\\nN.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!\\r\\nWhile I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!\\r\\nI think having Jeb\\'s endorsement hurts Lyin\\' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!\\r\\nI will be the best by far in fighting terror. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that was right from the beginning &amp; now Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted &amp; others are copying me.\\r\\nJust watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!\\r\\nLow energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted Cruz. Honestly I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!\\r\\nLyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas\\xe2\\x80\\x94 just another dishonest politician.\\r\\nThank you Arizona! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain\\r\\nLyin\\' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That\\'s why we call him Lyin\\' Ted!\\r\\nHopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!\\r\\nMuch bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!\\r\\nThank you Arizona! #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain\\r\\nIncompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!\\r\\nLyin\\' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin\\' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!\\r\\nPres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp; get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!\\r\\nObama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.\\r\\n#UtahCaucus message from @IvankaTrump! #UTCaucus#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n#ArizonaPrimary message from @IvankaTrump! #AZPrimary #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n#VoteTrump video: #AZPrimary #ArizonaPrimary #UtahCaucus #UTCaucus #AmericanSamoa\\r\\nMy heart &amp; prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.\\r\\nWatch this clip from earlier this year. Time &amp; time again I have been right about terrorism. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to get tough!\\r\\nI have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nPresident Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!\\r\\nDo you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!\\r\\nWow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn\\'t even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect\\r\\nBig Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!\\r\\nSo the highly overrated anchor @megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can\\'t fight back? Wrong!\\r\\nThe protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!\\r\\nWhy is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!\\r\\nWill be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!\\r\\nThe rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit.

Love Utah- will be back!\\r\\nWhy haven\\'t they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz\\'s guy runs Missouri?\\r\\nI guess I have reached yet another \"ceiling\"  - 49.7% with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you!\\r\\nDo you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!\\r\\nEverybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick &amp; the most overrated person on tv.\\r\\nThank you Arizona- I love you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nJoin me tomorrow! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nMitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn\\'t have a clue. No wonder he lost!\\r\\nFailed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp; Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2\\r\\nFailed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who \"choked\" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin\\' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!\\r\\nGoing to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally. Lyin\\' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don\\'t like LIARS!

Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.\\r\\nTed Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out &amp; said no!\\r\\nTed Cruz does not have the right \"temperment\" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!\\r\\nWow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.\\r\\nTed Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.\\r\\nTHANK YOU LAS VEGAS NEVADA!#NevadaCaucus #VoteTrumpNV\\r\\nJoin me live- now in Las Vegas Nevada! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpNV #NevadaCaucus\\r\\nTed Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens.

Sad.\\r\\nJust saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?\\r\\nTed Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!\\r\\nTed Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!\\r\\nWow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director.

I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!\\r\\nI hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $\\'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!\\r\\nThe reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!\\r\\nI am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!\\r\\nA number of months ago I was not expected to win South CarolinaTed Cruz was and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category.

Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThank you South Carolina!\\r\\nA quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb.\\r\\nThe failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board.

(HOPE)\\r\\nSouth Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nRemember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don\\'t allow it\\r\\nI wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!\\r\\nI am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!\\r\\nLying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall.

Together WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpSC\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you America! #Trump2016\\r\\nNew CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!\\r\\nI love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nThe just out USA Today National Poll where I lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup I beat both Hillary and Bernie.\\r\\nAmazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.\\r\\nJoin us tomorrow in Kiawah South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC#Trump2016\\r\\nTHANK YOU AMERICA! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nJeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it\\'s far too late. 1% in Nevada!\\r\\nJust out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.\\r\\n.@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!\\r\\nI will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won\\'t and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?\\r\\n.@lindseygraham who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.\\r\\nInteresting how President Obama so haltingly said I \"would never be president\" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!\\r\\nWhy does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!\\r\\nThank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon\\r\\n.@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!\\r\\nExplain to @brithume and @megynkelly who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!\\r\\nWill be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow.

Used massive private \"Eminent Domain\" --- Just another clueless politician!\\r\\nJeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)\\r\\nI\\'d like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)\\r\\nNow that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!\\r\\nI will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\\r\\nJeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada\\r\\nFunny that Jeb(!) didn\\'t want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn\\'t even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother!\\r\\nTed Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn\\'t!\\r\\nWow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!\\r\\nTickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!\\r\\nLoved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints\\r\\nThank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!\\r\\nThis shows what a complete &amp; total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn\\'t have nominated John Roberts. Really?\\r\\nEven though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!\\r\\n#GOPDebate #GoogleTrends\\r\\nHey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain!\\r\\nAll polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!\\r\\nHow can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can\\'t beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!\\r\\nThank you! I miss my father.\\r\\nLightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn\\'t know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! #GOPDebate\\r\\nOn the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.\\r\\nTed Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!\\r\\nNasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot &amp; I hold liberal positions. LIES!\\r\\nWow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington &amp; Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!\\r\\nThe totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!\\r\\nLove the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.\\r\\nThank you South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\n\"Get on Trump\\'s List\" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay. Email:\\r\\nA very big thank you to Bill Donohue head of The Catholic League for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight\\r\\nTotally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nThe RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.\\r\\nNow an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant.\\r\\nI am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nJust got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.\\r\\nWord is that little Morty Zuckerman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?\\r\\nWhen little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.\\r\\n11000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5000 outside. Will be back!\\r\\nI will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain!\\r\\nMillions of $\\'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.\\r\\nLast time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn\\'t do better this time he is out!\\r\\nIf @TedCruz doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clean up his act stop cheating &amp; doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.\\r\\nLightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!\\r\\nAfter hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads.\\r\\nNothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.\\r\\nYou must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary.\\r\\nThe failing @NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. It\\'s dead!\\r\\nNEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.Visit:  from @IvankaTrump:\\r\\nHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?\\r\\nLying Cruz put out a statement \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump &amp; Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage.\" Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?\\r\\nWeak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin &amp; others?\\r\\nTHANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana!

How can he preach Christian values?\\r\\nHeading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nWe are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest \"pushpolls\" on me. We are watching!\\r\\nJeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!\\r\\nHe (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nRemember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN\\'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT\\r\\n.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!\\r\\nJeb Bush spent more than $40000000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $3000000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!\\r\\nThere are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!\\r\\nI have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!\\r\\nTHANK YOU- Clemson South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary\\r\\nI was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.\\r\\nBig speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M.

Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.\\r\\nLike the worthless @NYDailyNews looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!\\r\\nWorthless @NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer!

His family used private eminent domain!\\r\\nRemember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (\"come as act of love\").

I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them take away our guns! #Trump2016Watch:\\r\\nThis is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum.\\r\\n.@oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.\\r\\n#ICYMI: @KarlRove &amp; @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote.\\r\\nThank you @billoreilly &amp; @KarlRove. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.\\r\\nSanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn\\'t want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!\\r\\nTHANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016\\r\\nStop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!#VotersSpeak:\\r\\nThank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN\\r\\nDr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for \"deceit and dirty tricks and lies.\"\\r\\nCruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!\\r\\nThe State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!\\r\\nThis was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud\\r\\nI will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews\\r\\nBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\\r\\nAnd finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and \"choice\" - a total lie!\\r\\nThe Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud\\r\\nMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.\\r\\nDuring primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.\\r\\nTed Cruz didn\\'t win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\\r\\nGreat job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN\\r\\nOn my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #FITN #Trump2016\\r\\nAnybody who watched all of Ted Cruz\\'s far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!\\r\\n.@Morning_Joe  @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro\"\\r\\nI don\\'t believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!\\r\\nI will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd\\r\\nThe media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!\\r\\nBecause I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor\\r\\nMy experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn\\'t do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice\\r\\nIt all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nJoin us! #CaucusForTrump11am WATERLOO:  CEDER RAPIDS:\\r\\n.@DonaldJTrumpJr &amp; his wife @MrsVanessaTrump attended the #SnowflakeGardenBrunch- here w/ Governor @TerryBranstad.\\r\\nWatch @IvankaTrump show you how easy it is to #CaucusForTrump in Iowa! #IACaucus Video:\\r\\nSo nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa!

Enjoy!\\r\\nI am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY!\\r\\nIf I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $6000000.\\r\\nBy not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing \"unfairness\" - while raising $6000000 for VETS.\\r\\nWow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!\\r\\nTed Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!\\r\\nTed Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!\\r\\nI will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!\\r\\n.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn\\'t give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends\\r\\n.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends\\r\\n.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!\\r\\nThe Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters \"in violation.\" They are now under investigation. Bad!\\r\\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump\\r\\n#IACaucus #CaucusForTrump#iCaucused #iVoted\\r\\nI want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I\\'ve received on the campaign trail.

Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!\\r\\n.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta\\r\\nThe great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.\\r\\nThe new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?\\r\\nThank you for all of your support Iowa!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016#IACaucus finder:\\r\\nThey say that if I participated in last night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fox debate they would have had 12 million more &amp; would have broken the all time record.\\r\\nThank you America! #Trump2016Via @DRUDGE_REPORT\\r\\nJoin me tomorrow in Dubuque Iowa! #IACaucus #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you- Nashua New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n\"Every American needs to say 2 simple words to every Vet they meet: THANK YOU!\" John Wayne Walding\\r\\nThank you!Mitchell FOX2 Michigan Poll finds Trump holds 3-1 lead over closest GOP opponents.

No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.\\r\\nCruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.\\r\\nCruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn\\'t disclose.

I will NOT forget!\\r\\nWhy does @CNN &amp; @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?\\r\\n.@EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016\\r\\nTHANK YOU! #VoteTrump\\r\\nTHANK YOU IOWA! Highly respected @OANN @GravisMarketing poll just released. #VoteTrump #IowaCaucus\\r\\nThank you! #VoteTrump\\r\\nMy nomination would increase voter turnout. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nSadly there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!\\r\\nThank you for your support last night Iowa! #VoteTrump #Trump2016 #IACaucus #FITN #IAPolitics\\r\\nIran toys with U.S. days before we pay them ridiculously billions of dollars. Don\\'t release money. We want our hostages back NOW!\\r\\nNumerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!\\r\\nThe State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!\\r\\nJust found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice but OK! New polls are great.\\r\\nThe #SOTU speech is really boring slow lethargic - very hard to watch!\\r\\nThe Iran deal is terrible. Why didn\\'t we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU\\r\\nNew CBS poll. #Trump2016\\r\\nAnother new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN\\r\\nSuch a serious problem for Ted &amp; the GOP. Great doubt Dems will sue! Let\\'s all work together to solve this problem.\\r\\nOn my way to Cedar Falls Iowa now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!\\r\\nTHANK YOU! #Trump2016\\r\\nThe Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes.

Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson\\r\\n.@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda bad reporter!\\r\\nThank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!\\r\\nWill be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE. Enjoy! #Trump2016\\r\\n.@megynkelly recently said that she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way who the hell wants to woo her!\\r\\nNew Iowa poll. Thank you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n.@RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.\\r\\nCongratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! Thank you!\\r\\nJust arrived in New Hampshire. Thank you to all of my supporters!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nSo professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won\\'t survive highly unethical!\\r\\nGreat job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!\\r\\nCongratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!\\r\\nWhy does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater &amp; racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him!\\r\\nThank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016\\r\\nUnion Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters try getting a new publisher!\\r\\nUL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren\\'t worthy of representing the great people NH.\\r\\nThis is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.\\r\\nIf their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win.\\r\\nI am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.\\r\\nRemember get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...\\r\\nHeading now for Reno Nevada for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!\\r\\nIn the just out @FoxNews Poll I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn\\'t even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nYesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!\\r\\nI want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!\\r\\nWill be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!\\r\\nI will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!\\r\\nI\\'m protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn\\'t give them the right to be involved!\\r\\n(2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it!\\r\\n(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.\\r\\nThank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person.\\r\\n.@JonahNRO watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.\\r\\nThank you @TheFix- Chris Cillizza. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion &amp; do what is right.\\r\\nConstitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says \"wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn\\'t settled).\\r\\nSouth Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!\\r\\nPat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat way ahead of your time!\\r\\nGreat even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5000 turned away. Thank you for coming!\\r\\nWill be at venue in wonderful South Carolina very soon. Big traffic back-up tremendous crowd! Will be wild.\\r\\n#FoxNews Poll - THANK YOU!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nLove seeing union &amp; non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compete!\\r\\nI hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them sell you out!\\r\\nOn my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!\\r\\nNot good news for Jeb Bush\\r\\nHank Greenberg formerly of AIG gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy a total waste of money!\\r\\nGreat time in Burlington Vermont. Crowd was amazing.\\r\\nWe could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable!\\r\\nI\\'m leaving now for Burlington Vermont. It will be wild!\\r\\nJoy Behar who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!\\r\\nThe @TheView @ABC once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!\\r\\nHillary and her friends!\\r\\nWeak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!\\r\\nI have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don\\'t be ashamed of it!\\r\\n.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!\\r\\nMassive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!\\r\\nMan shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!\\r\\nI will be in beautiful Burlington Vermont tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nIt was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!\\r\\n.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.\\r\\nThe failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid how desperate!\\r\\nDo you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them just received:\\r\\nI will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.\\r\\nHuge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come first serve. Arrive early!\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like @SamuelLJackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s golf swing.  Not athletic. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won many club championships. Play him for charity!\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats\\xe2\\x80\\x94with his game he has no choice\\xe2\\x80\\x94and stop doing commercials!\\r\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @EricTrump! Very proud of you!\\r\\nGermany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!\\r\\nI am in New Hampshire. Just received great news from Reuters poll. Thank you for your support!\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know @SamuelLJackson to best of my knowledge haven\\'t played golf w/him &amp; think he does too many TV commercials\\xe2\\x80\\x94boring. Not a fan.\\r\\nWow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75000 to around 10\\xe2\\x80\\x94bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.\\r\\nThe rally in Lowell Massachusetts was amazing. 10000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nWoody Johnson owner of the NYJets is @JebBush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finance chairman. If Woody would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been w/me he would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in the playoffs at least!\\r\\nI look forward to being in Lowell Massachusetts today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!\\r\\nBy the way Hillary &amp; the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video.\\r\\nThe worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.\\r\\nIran with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia &amp; their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!\\r\\n.@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying\\r\\n.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that \"attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before.\" Wrong - attacked him in \\'08 &amp; won!\\r\\nDoes anybody remember when Bill Clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.\\r\\nThank you for your support in Biloxi MS! Let\\'s ALL get out &amp; VOTE in 2016 so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!\\r\\nHillary said that guns don\\'t keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!\\r\\nAl-Shabbab not ISIS just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them which I must. Hillary lied!\\r\\nHillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.\\r\\nJust returned from Mississippi - a great evening.\\r\\nThank you #Biloxi #Mississippi! Remember this night &amp; spread the word to get out &amp; #VoteTrump2016!\\r\\nJust arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!\\r\\nHeading to Biloxi Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump2016\\r\\nRemember I am self-funding my campaign the only one in either party. I\\'m not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!\\r\\nWhen I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!\\r\\nI hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women\\'s issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!\\r\\nHillary Clinton doesn\\'t have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better!\\r\\nHillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!\\r\\n.@JebBush is a low energy \"stiff\" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!\\r\\n.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!\\r\\nMassive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS:\\r\\n#VoteTrump2016 &amp; together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! THANK YOU for your support!\\r\\nThank you so much to  for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!\\r\\nThe person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is by far me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!\\r\\nI will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.\\r\\nWell the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!\\r\\nHappy New Year from #MarALago! Thank you to my great family for all of their support.\\r\\n#HappyNewYearAmerica!\\r\\nHAPPY NEW YEAR &amp; THANK YOU!\\r\\nI will be on @FoxNews live  with members of my family at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO FINALLY MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nDo you believe that The State Department on NEW YEAR\\'S EVE just released more of Hillary\\'s e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!\\r\\nTHANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let\\'s not forget to get family &amp; friends- out to VOTE IN 2016!\\r\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT\\r\\nI would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $\\'s of hit ads on me\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nPeople ask \"why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls?\" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!\\r\\n.@JebBush has spent  $63000000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewitt\\r\\nA GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nI predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher \"Stinky\" Joe McQuaid will be dead in 2 years!\\r\\nA lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now.\\r\\nGreat poll- thank you Nevada!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nI\\'m going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!\\r\\nThank you Hilton Head South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you Hilton Head South Carolina! @SCTeamTrump #Trump2016\\r\\nI never thought I\\'d be saying this but I\\'ve really enjoyed  @RichLowry on television lately and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity\\r\\nJoe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader. It\\'s a loser and my comments haven\\'t helped him much.\\r\\nThe dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!\\r\\nIowa was fantastic last night amazing crowd and people. I\\'m now in Florida getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd very exciting\\r\\n.@CharlesHurt   You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nTHANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa! The silent majority is silent no more!#Trump2016 #FITN\\r\\nJoe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.\\r\\nThe great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.\\r\\nShows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn\\'t do his failed debate!\\r\\nI hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans &amp; America!\\r\\nWe need a real President!\\r\\nLooking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today. Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!\\r\\nSo I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp; done. Run country my way!\\r\\nMy campaign for president is $35000000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.\\r\\n\"Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump\" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\n.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!\\r\\nRemember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!\\r\\nThank you- Nashua New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 #NHPolitics #FITN\\r\\nThank you! #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video:\\r\\nStrange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I\\'m lowering taxes while he will double &amp; triple them a disaster!\\r\\nWages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!\\r\\nMany of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!\\r\\nThe middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD\\r\\nIf Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women\\'s card on me she\\'s wrong!\\r\\nHopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia\\'s Republican Party. FAST!\\r\\nStraighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC\\r\\n.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!\\r\\nThe voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!\\r\\nR.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!\\r\\nIt begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!\\r\\nI will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!\\r\\nThank you! #Trump2016\\r\\nHillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE\\'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate!\\r\\nA new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Story:\\r\\nCriminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!\\r\\nThe Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it\\r\\nThe same people that said I wouldn\\'t run or that I wouldn\\'t lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won\\'t beat Hillary.\\r\\n.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!\\r\\n@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don\\'t WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!\\r\\nWhen will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say \"we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?\" Never!\\r\\nOur great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!\\r\\nRemember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He\\'s spent $59 million and is at 3%.\\r\\nWe have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\nDoes everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!\\r\\n.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!\\r\\nMerry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!\\r\\n.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!\\r\\n.@HallieJackson Why didn\\'t you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!\\r\\nI am now in Palm Beach Florida and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\r\\n.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!\\r\\nWhy isn\\'t @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!\\r\\nWow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It\\'s about time!\\r\\nNext year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly\\r\\nThird rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!\\r\\nWow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I\\'m at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!\\r\\nIn the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn\\'t allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!\\r\\nPoor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He\\'s bottom (and gone) I\\'m top (by a lot). That\\'s what U.S. needs!\\r\\nA great Christmas movie &amp; perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Story:\\r\\nHillary said \"I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign.\" I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity\\r\\nMerry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nHillary when you complain about \"a penchant for sexism\" who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!\\r\\nIt is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead\\r\\nWhy does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump\\r\\n.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!\\r\\nThe @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad\\r\\nThe silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThe Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you America! Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!\\r\\nBig news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10\\r\\nWe need a PRESIDENT with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!\\r\\nIt is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!\\r\\nWhen I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nWow new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!\\r\\nFor those on TV defending my use of the word \"schlonged\" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM\\r\\nNPR\\'s @NealConan said \"schlonged\" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: \"That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls.\" #Hypocrisy\\r\\nOnce again #MSM is dishonest. \"Schlonged\" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got \"schlonged\" that meant beaten badly.\\r\\nJeb\\'s big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn\\'t have me answering Jeb\\'s statements. He is really pathetic!\\r\\nWatching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!\\r\\nWomen defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rally.VIDEO:\\r\\n.@JebBush\\'s opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent.\\r\\nWhy doesn\\'t @JebBush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate?\\r\\nWill @JebBush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?\\r\\n.@JebBush just took millions of $\\'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!\\r\\nWeak and low energy @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.\\r\\nVideo from Michigan last night. After asking for months the media panned their cameras!\\r\\nTHANK YOU America! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you - Michigan!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you - New Hampshire!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nTHANK YOU Grand Rapids Michigan! Time to end political correctness &amp; secure our homeland!\\r\\n@HerschelWalker thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated!\\r\\nGetting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.\\r\\nDo you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about \"the video\" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.\\r\\nThanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!\\r\\nA suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!\\r\\nIt\\'s the Democrats\\' total weakness &amp; incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!\\r\\nPhyllis Schlafly: Trump is \\'last hope for America\\'\\r\\nGetting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!\\r\\nJust out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18000000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6700000. And they were on major network vs. cable!\\r\\nHillary said with respect to ISIS \"we are finally where we need to be.\" Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!\\r\\nI demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.\\r\\nHillary said at debate ISIS is \"going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst.\" She made up story-want apology!\\r\\nVery sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!\\r\\n.@JebBush today said he didn\\'t want to be the front-runner he would rather be where he is now 2%. That is the talk of a loser can\\'t win!\\r\\nGreat poll out of Illinois! Thank you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n.@MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people great new owner @IMG. WATCH.\\r\\nMy friend @AriEmanuel of @IMG bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox! Tune in!\\r\\nIt was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!\\r\\nHillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!\\r\\n.@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!\\r\\nWe need a #POTUS with great strength &amp; stamina. Hillary does not have that.#Trump2016\\r\\nHillary Clinton lied when she said that \"ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool.\" This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE\\r\\n.@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nThank you America! @FoxNews post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll. #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nThank you Cedar Rapids Iowa!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nPresident Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.\\r\\nSee Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate hurting himself and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!\\r\\nAnother new post-debate poll. THANK YOU! #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nThank you for all of your support! Most importantly - we need to get everyone out to VOTE! #VoteTrump2016\\r\\nThe last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!\\r\\n.@JebBush has embarrassed himself &amp; his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself.\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nWeak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!\\r\\nI have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name &amp; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be ashamed of it!\\r\\n.@MelindaDC  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out after I get elected.\\r\\nAs I have been saying. Only the beginning: \"ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey 150 European Passports Seized.\"\\r\\nNew Reuters poll - thank you!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\n#ISIS is making $400M/year on oil.

Thank you for your support! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nHillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength no stamina.\\r\\nJeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he\\'ll probably take some of his special interest money he is their puppet and buy ad\\'s.\\r\\nThank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. The debate was interesting and fun. Keep up the great work!\\r\\nWill be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Will be talking about the debate and more!\\r\\nBill O\\'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant.

Look forward -   hope I get treated fairly!\\r\\nI wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!\\r\\n.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.\\r\\n.@megynkelly the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!\\r\\nWhy isn\\'t anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press\\r\\nIsn\\'t it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13% 33% to 20% - then doesn\\'t use it\\r\\nWow I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%.

I love Billy!\\r\\nGetting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.\\r\\n.@AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.\\r\\nI think it would be a good idea\\xe2\\x80\\x94and fair\\xe2\\x80\\x94to include @GovChristie &amp; @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid &amp; good guys. @FoxBusiness\\r\\nCarson now admits his friend named \"Bob\" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!) no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!\\r\\nWith Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don\\'t people get it?\\r\\nSuch bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson \"is trying to solidify his lead.\" But I am #1 easily! Sad\\r\\nFlorida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.\\r\\nA great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!\\r\\nThe Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!\\r\\nRubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame!\\r\\n.@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I \"ran for president twice.\" Never ran merely considered running!\\r\\nJeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio \"he\\'s my friend!\" Pure political speak. Why can\\'t he be truthful and say \"disloyal guy no friend!\"\\r\\nAlso tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.\\r\\nI will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow. Enjoy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nWow! @FoxNews poll just came out. #1 with 26%! Almost as importantly I am the strongest on economic issues by far! #Trump2016\\r\\nJust landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!\\r\\nIsn\\'t it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down but refuses to use it now when I am up?\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nI will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE talking about my new book #CrippledAmerica and much more! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\\r\\nMarco Rubio would keep Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive order on amnesty intact. See article. Cannot be President.\\r\\n.@CharlesGKoch is looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered. He now likes Rubio--next fail.\\r\\nJoin me today Nov 3rd in #TrumpTowerNYC at noon. I\\'ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.

Dishonest reporting!\\r\\nMeet me at @TrumpTowerNY and get your copy of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA signed on 11/3 at 12pm!\\r\\nThank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration-a mess!Great job @kilmeade\\r\\n.@Morning_Joe: Marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people. I won every on-line poll even crazy @CNBC. Marco good looking?\\r\\nSirius National News at 7:30 A.M. Steve Bannon. @BreitbartNews\\r\\nNow that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S.\\r\\nThank you @JoeTrippi for the nice and true words on #Media Buzz with terrific Howie Kurtz. Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews\\r\\nWhile in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.\\r\\nJoin me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I\\'ll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don\\'t miss it!\\r\\nIf Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!\\r\\nMarco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\".\\r\\nI told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!\\r\\nJeb\\'s new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics!\\r\\nAnybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: \"\\r\\nFurther proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer\\'s Mr. Amnesty endorsement.Rubs can\\'t win\\r\\nGov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time &amp; money!\\r\\n.@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said \"NO THANKS\" Waste of time &amp; energy!\\r\\nFew people know that  @FortuneMagazine is still in business. Tell your writer  Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president\\r\\nNo complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn\\'t in them? Interesting question!\\r\\nThank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!\\r\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\r\\nSupport Coach Kennedy and his right together with his young players to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!\\r\\nJust left Virginia where I unveiled my healthcare and other plans for our great Veterans! They will be very happy!\\r\\n.@ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I\\'d do his show @TheHerd on Monday (2:30pm EST).\\r\\nThe @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!\\r\\nLifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya\\'\\r\\nI told you so-@politico just lost it\\'s top person. Poor results and no money to pay him. If they were legit they would be doing far better!\\r\\nI am leaving for Norfolk Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!\\r\\nI see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac which are total scams. Marco must address him as \"SIR\"!\\r\\nThe new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.\\r\\nBlack Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS CHINA RUSSIA etc.\\r\\nI am going to save Medicare and Medicaid Carson wants to abolish and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn\\'t have a clue - weak!\\r\\nWhen candidate John Kasich on the @oreillyfactor talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid he was referring to Ben Carson.\\r\\n.@GovMikeHuckabee Great job on @FoxNews tonight.

Sad!\\r\\n.@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt\\'s poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!\\r\\n.@CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers. Number one based on every statistic is Trump (by a wide margin).

I suspect he may talk!\\r\\nMake the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say \"speak to my lawyers.\"\\r\\nDon\\'t forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!\\r\\nI don\\'t know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.\\r\\nGreat sportscaster Al Michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National LA.

We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH\\r\\nWhen the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings-maimings\\r\\nI hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as \"the suspect\".\\r\\nThe shirts and ties at Macy\\'s are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass\\r\\nI just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.\\r\\nOh no they are worried that they didn\\'t read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t\\r\\n@PierceCorey   Great going!\\r\\nSorry  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost.

A champion!\\r\\nI was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star Kevin Garnett @Celtics said to a crowd \"Forget Shaq I want to meet Donald Trump.\"\\r\\nWatch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency\\r\\nI\\'m not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.\\r\\nThe President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won\\'t be doing it. What is he hiding?\\r\\nWatch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC\\r\\nThe polls &amp; momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don\\'t let the hurricane change your thinking!\\r\\nFans shouldn\\'t worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.\\r\\nChina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses  Their market gains the day we are hit by storm\\r\\nMaybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?\\r\\nScary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?\\r\\nPeople are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.\\r\\nWhy does Obama believe he shouldn\\'t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?\\r\\n@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity\\r\\nGlad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!\\r\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be honest if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.\\r\\nHow did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12 the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?\\r\\n\"Without focus it\\'s just impossible to be successful at anything.\" --Midas Touch\\r\\nI never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ali G\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interview\\r\\nAnother great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.\\r\\nMy @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama\\r\\nMy @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm\\r\\nThese last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.\\r\\nThe election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can\\'t afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.\\r\\nSo many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!\\r\\nThe Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm--thanks staff!\\r\\nRemember this: Obama wants to raise taxes @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!\\r\\nDon\\'t let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.\\r\\nPeople having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others I stayed open.\\r\\nI am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.\\r\\nBecause of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama\\'s favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.\\r\\nNot only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don\\'t fall for it.\\r\\nHurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.\\r\\nI saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.\\r\\nThe water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.\\r\\nAll weights are on crane\\'s wrong side ---  very precarious below move out!\\r\\nIf authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower call office.\\r\\nDirect view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze.\\r\\nWe are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.\\r\\nSo far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let\\'s see what happens later.\\r\\nMany people walked out on Madonna\\'s concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!\\r\\nI always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he (cont)\\r\\nObama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.\\r\\nDave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was \"probably\" born in the US--the word \"probably\" is a disaster for Obama.\\r\\nI\\'m not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.\\r\\nWhat people don\\'t know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont)\\r\\nI guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill you are no Letterman.\\r\\nWhile @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.\\r\\n.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I\\'m not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won\\'t. Is this a double standard?\\r\\nMany people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.\\r\\nA lot changed when David Letterman said \" he was probably born in this country\"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.\\r\\n@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!\\r\\n@BernardMcGuirk. That\\'s more than O\\'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You\\'re terrific!\\r\\n@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O\\'Reilly...you\\'re terrific!\\r\\nAlert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.\\r\\n@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But he just doesn\\'t have what it takes...and he never will.\\r\\nI put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.\\r\\nI want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.\\r\\nThe TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.\\r\\nBefore Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofessionally dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I saved her tiny...\\r\\nI hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL.

Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah.\\r\\n...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.\\r\\nObama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess.
